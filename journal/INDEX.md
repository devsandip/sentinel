## Where we are now

Sentinel is a governed agentic data-science demo, built as an interview
credibility artifact for an SVP AI Product Management role at a bank. The thesis:
agentic AI can be made governed, auditable, and shippable in a regulated bank.
The ML is kept small on purpose; the governance harness is the star.

The full app is built and now stable. A four-agent pipeline (Profiler, EDA,
Modeler, Validator) plus a plain-Python orchestrator runs a real
logistic-regression analysis on UCI German Credit, pauses at a human approval
gate, and completes with a fairness review, an eval gate, and a generated
SR 11-7-style model card (PDF). Every agent action flows through the governance
harness (audit, RBAC, PII, guardrails, eval gate, cost). Two controls fire on
every run (an RBAC denial and a PII redaction), and the age-band fairness check
flags a real disparity (0.57). The six-tab Streamlit UI is verified end to end.

A recurring Streamlit segfault was root-caused (via the macOS crash report) to
pyarrow's mimalloc allocator, not sklearn/OpenMP as first assumed. The single
fix is `ARROW_DEFAULT_MEMORY_POOL=system`, set in the launcher. All the earlier
OpenMP thread-pinning was tested, shown to do nothing, and removed.

Stack: Streamlit (Python only). 36 tests passing, ruff clean. Run locally with
`./run.sh`.

The build now has a clean per-phase git history and is public at
https://github.com/devsandip/sentinel. It is live on AWS with HTTPS on a custom
domain: https://sentinel.sandip.dev.

The stack is CloudFront in front of a single-instance Elastic Beanstalk env.
CloudFront terminates TLS with an ACM cert and forwards to the EB instance over
HTTP, passing the WebSocket through (caching disabled, all viewer headers
forwarded). EB is a single t3.small, no load balancer, about 15 dollars a month;
CloudFront adds pennies at demo traffic. Verified end to end: valid cert, health
ok, http-to-https redirect, WebSocket 101, and the full UI renders in a browser.
Redeploy the app with `AWS_PROFILE=admin ./deploy/aws/deploy.sh`; the HTTPS front
is `./deploy/aws/enable-https.sh` (idempotent).

The next chapter is the platform buildout. The demo proves one governed analysis;
the target role is an AI platform PM, so the job now is to make Sentinel the paved
road that makes any agent governed by default. The proposal is written and
reviewed at `docs/features/platform-buildout.md`: 13 platform elements folded in
across four phases, each with a visible surface. Decisions locked: LangGraph for
orchestration (static graph, interrupt as the human gate, checkpointer as memory);
real AWS pgvector on RDS for the vector store; OpenTelemetry plus promptfoo plus
Ragas for observability and evals; a runnable MCP server; per-agent guardrail
control envelopes with a live on/off toggle (the headline demo device); five
identity personas with a role-aware gate. Starting Phase A (patterns, playbooks,
agent templates, the LangGraph DAG) now.

## Recent weekly summaries

None yet. Week 2026-W28 (through Sun 2026-07-12) has entries but no summary.

## Working hypotheses

- A naturally-flagging fairness result is more convincing than a staged one. Keep it real.
- The model card PDF is the single highest-leverage showpiece.
- A control is only credible if it can be seen firing. Force RBAC and PII to fire every run.

## Open questions

- Do we exercise live-LLM mode with a real key before the interview, or leave it scripted?
- Capture a demo GIF/Loom for the README, now that there is a live HTTPS URL to record.
- Platform buildout open items (from the proposal): OK to add the standing ~12-15 dollar/mo RDS pgvector cost, or precompute-and-pause? Final persona set? Final playbook set? Record an external-agent-over-MCP clip?

## Things ruled out

- Next.js + FastAPI split (chose Streamlit for speed).
- fairlearn dependency (implemented metrics directly for auditability).
- ~~LangGraph~~ — reversed 2026-07-13. Adopting LangGraph for the platform buildout. Its graph is static (fixed nodes/edges), so it stays an inspectable workflow, and its interrupt/checkpointer primitives map onto the human gate and memory. The plain state machine was right for the single-pipeline demo, wrong for the platform.
- OpenMP/BLAS thread pinning as the crash fix (tested, did nothing, removed). The real fix is the pyarrow memory pool.
- FRED data (macro time-series does not fit the classification/fairness story).
- Render and Fly for the host (chose AWS Elastic Beanstalk).
- AWS Amplify (Hosting only runs JS frontends; it cannot run a persistent Python Streamlit server).
- A custom nginx override on EB (the default AL2023 nginx already forwards WebSocket upgrade headers).
